Uniform and Logarithmic Quantization along with Resampling and Filtering of RGB images.
This project will help you gain a practical understanding of Resampling, Quantization and Filtering to understand how these processes affect visual media types like images and video. The motivation here comes from the fact that high valued content is created/saved as a master copy with a high resolution in both samples and color. This master copy may then be appropriately scaled down for distribution depending on the platform. The conversion process needs to ensure that the final product is of the highest quality possible given the constraints. Eg For Digital Cinema, frames are mastered at 4K resolution(4096x2160 pixels) with each pixel at 12 bits per color channel (total 36 bits). For distribution via blue ray/DVD, the image frame may be down sampled to HD format (1920x1080 pixels) with each pixel at 8 bits per channel (total 24 bits). In this assignment we will not use such high resolution but will be starting with moderately high 512x512 images at 24 bit color depth and then further resample/requantize.
